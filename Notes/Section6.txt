There are number of changes required in settings.py when deploying the project in Production Environment.
Diff. config of settings.py for diffferent environments.
doesn't matter whats the name of settings file and where it is placed until the correct path is mentioned in the manage.py file under os.environ.setdefault().
we can put multiple settings file for diff env(local.py for local and production.py for production environment) under same setting folder and file related to either of the env will load ased on the condition DEBUG = True/False ( True for local and False for Production). We provide condition in manage.py file.
DEUG = True, means local and the diagnostic report will be visible on webpage if any error occurs to unauhtrised users too, but in production it is False, so that things are only visile at terminal.
importing base.py file to either of the setting files we can resuse the code and with less code we can run server for each environment.
When server runs for local env, then we get O/P as " Django version 4.1.7, using settings 'core.settings.local' "
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] is a security measure which prevents HTTP host header attacks. So when app is in prod server, we need to define the allowed host which can be a list of strings representing all the host domain names that Django sites can be served on, "which typically is the IP address of the server" - this is a production setting
When server runs for local env, then we get O/P as " Django version 4.1.7, using settings 'core.settings.production' "
By default every Django project has Secret Key which is genrated during the project building at start.
Secret key is not public and is used to provide cryptographic signing
min length of secret key can be 1 character but it should be preferebly long.
We can use manage.py shell to use python and gen secret key
in shell:
>>> from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
>>> print(get_random_secret key())

We can use seperate secret keys for local and production env.
Building list of installed packages helps in replicating the project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creting Environment Varibles gives extra security to the sensitive data by hooking the data outside of the program and use the data whenever required.
Avoid secret keys and passwords to be accessexdc easily by anyone. So we create environmernt varibles in native OS.
We install python-dotenv package using pip and the create a .env file along with manage.py file
We brush all ther sensitive data from settings.py and save it in .env file created.
We need to hook .env file with settings.py file else server won't run ( for e.g. without secret key server won't run)
we import load_dotenv from dotenv and use load_dotenv(). again, environment variables are stored in OS, so we need OS module of python to get those variables
So we import os and use os.environ.get() method.

TESTING - Pytest First Steps

> pytest is used for tesitng purposes.
> created a pytest.ini file along with manage.py which is a configuration file that contains key value pairs.
> pytest -h shows all the key-value pairs that can be configured.
> all tests are written in .py files under tests folder and a run using pytest command.
>
>We use classes or functions to make test files.

. Source Control helps tracking the changes and managing the changes.
. We create a repository on github and clone it local. 
After cloning we put all the project related data to the folder.
. Some files that we do not need to push on version control, we put that files and folders in .gitignore file. So that every time we commit changes, thiose are ignored by git. Like .env file, __pycahce__ file , it needs to be ignored.

> We add all the changes to staging area using : git add * and then commiting all the changes to main branch: git commit -m <message>

> after successful commits we push the code to repository as: git push origin <branch_name>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>We create our viewsets that is essentially the login where actual request from the client resides and is processed , ready for us to collect data then from database and then return it back to the client.

>> VIEWSETS are class based views.

NOTE: Request to API from client comes to Django server and then Django checks and matches with the URL present in the urls.py, if matched passes the object to the corresponding view.


Django view can be defined using class as well as functions.

Using Router in urls.py is automating the task for defining each path.
> Each CRUD operations is an individual request and for each request, it potentially requires its own path. So with Router it automatically creates path for each request for us ased upon the informtation supplied within the code.
> Paths to be created are utlized from viewsets as what type of viewsets we use
> We use the info present in viewset to actually create the endpoints we need.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API DOCUMENTATION: It is done using two components DRF Spectecular and Swagger UI which automate the process of API documentation.
> DRF Spectecular collects all the information about the API and put that into a format which can the be utilized by a front end package i.e. Swagger UI that present that collected information to the other developers or anyone who wants to interact with our API.
